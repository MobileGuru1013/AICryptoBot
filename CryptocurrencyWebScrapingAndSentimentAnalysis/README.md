# CryptocurrencyWebScrapingAndSentimentAnalysis
A python project combining web scraping and natural language processing. The project scrapes  the 'www.bitcointalk.org'
 forum and Reddit for recent historical posts and uses the python Natural Language Toolkit to perform sentiment analysis
 on them.

## Applications
 This project was developed to generate non-price data to train the CryptoCurrencyTrader project.

## Setup
To run as a standalone script add a file named API_settings.py containing your google and reddit API login:
google_username = ""  
google_password = ""  
client_id = ""  
client_secret = ""    
user_agent = 'Python Scraping App'
